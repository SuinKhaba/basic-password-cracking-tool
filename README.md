# Basic Password Cracking Tool

This project demonstrates basic password hashing, salting, and brute-force cracking techniques implemented in Python. It is designed for educational purposes to understand cryptographic weaknesses and how password cracking tools work at a fundamental level.

---

## Objective

To analyze and implement brute-force password cracking tools while understanding:
- Hash functions (like SHA-256, SHA-1, etc)
- Salting techniques
- Brute-force attacks using wordlists

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 3
- hashlib (standard library)
- os & random (for salting)
- Wordlist-based brute-force logic
